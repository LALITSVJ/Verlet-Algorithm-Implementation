# Verlet-Algorithm-Implementation
Verlet Integration method implementation for Ar Gas in Python language

Verlet integration is a numerical method used to integrate Newton's equations of motion. It is frequently used to calculate trajectories of particles in molecular dynamics simulations and computer graphics.

In this project (Lab assignment), Verlet algorithm has been implemented for a inert gas in python language.

Problem Statement: A container is filled with an inert gas having 'n' number of molecules. Task is to find the position and velocity of those molecules after time interval 't' using Verlet algorithm. Print the position and velocity matrices and plot position and velocity graphs.
